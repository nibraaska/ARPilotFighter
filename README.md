# ARPilotFighter

ARPilotFighter is a simple augmented reality android application created with Unity. 
This project was used to learn how Unity works along with the android operating system to create augmented reality apps.

The actual application is a fighter pilot game where the user is in the cockpit of a fighter jet with enemy jets flying around the screen in a set pattern. 
With the use of a laser gun, the user can shoot down the enemy planes. Once the jets are shot down, they respawn.
